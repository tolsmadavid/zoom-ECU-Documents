@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the COMP peripheral to compare the external
voltage applied on a specific pin with a sawtooth signal generated by a DAC. 

In this example, the comparator input is connected on the pin PB1 (pin 33 on connector CN6) the user shall vary the voltage on it
by actioning potentiometer RV2.
The DAC output is connected internally to comparator other input, and externally to the pin PA4 (pin 41 on connector CN6).
The comparator output is connected to the pin PF4 (pin 57 on connector CN6).

LED1 state:
  - "ON" when comparator output is high.
  - "OFF" when comparator output is low.
  - toggling twice at a frequency of 1Hz when an error occurred.

User can probe this 3 signals:
1 - Comparator INP: PB1 (pin 33 on connector CN6)
2 - Comparator INM: PA4 (pin 41 on connector CN6)
3 - Comparator OUT: PF4 (pin 57 on connector CN6)
To observe that when INP is above INM, OUT is high. Otherwise, OUT is low.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides 
      accurate delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. 
      This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower) than the 
      peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked. 
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set 
      to 1 millisecond to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32G474xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with STM32G474E-EVAL Rev B board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - Connect jumper JP5 on 2-3 position (LDR)
  - Connect a wire between JP5 pin 1 and PB1
