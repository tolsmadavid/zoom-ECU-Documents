@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use the built-in PGA mode (OPAMP programmable gain).

- Test description:
      - The example uses the the built-in PGA mode (OPAMP programmable gain).
      - The DMA provides samples (sinewave) to the DAC. 
      - The DAC peripheral generates a sine wave signal on DAC1/DAC_CHANNEL_1 (PA4) which is
        amplified by the OPAMP1. 
      - The OPAMP1 amplifies output is on PA2 with gain of either 2 or 4.
        The OPAMP gain is changed on the fly while OPAMP remains enabled.
      - The test steps are:
      - Step 0:
      	DAC:     normal power mode
      	OPAMP:   normal power mode - gain = 2
      	DMA:     circular mode - DMA half transfer IT handled by Cortex
      	Cortex:  run mode
      - Step from 1:
      	DAC:     normal power mode
      	OPAMP:   normal power mode - gain is changed from 2 to 4 or from 4 to 2
      	DMA:     circular mode - DMA half transfer IT handled by Cortex
      	Cortex:  run mode

- Connection needed:
      - Connect an oscilloscope to (DAC1/DAC_CHANNEL_1, PA4: pin 41 on connector CN6) 
        to display the sine wave signal generated by the DAC 
        (800 mV amplitude peak to peak). (DAC ouptut = OPAMP input).
      - Connect an oscilloscope to (OPAMP1_OUT, PA2: pin 43 on connector CN6) pin to display waveform  
        (OPAMP output)
      - Press User push-button button to switch between steps.
      - Connect a wire between DAC output (PA4 - pin 41 on connector CN6) to OPAMP non inverting input (PA3 - pin 42 on connector CN6)

@par Hardware and Software environment  
  
  - This example runs on STM32G474xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32G474E-EVAL Rev B board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

Connect a wire between DAC output (PA4 - pin 41 on connector CN6) to OPAMP non inverting input (PA3 - pin 42 on connector CN6)

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
