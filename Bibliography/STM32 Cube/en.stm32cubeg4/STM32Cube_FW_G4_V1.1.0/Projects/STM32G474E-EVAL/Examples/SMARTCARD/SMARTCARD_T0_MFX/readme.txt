@par Example Description

This example describes a firmware smartcard Interface based on USART.
The main purpose of this firmware example is to provide resources
that ease the development of applications using USART in smartcard mode.

The firmware interface is composed of library source files developed in order to
support ISO7816-3/4 specification, an application example is also provided.

This example is based on the AN2598 "Smartcard interface with the STM32F101xx
and STM32F103xx" application note. For more details, please refer to AN2598
available on www.st.com

ST sample Smartcard, provided with STM32G474E-EVAL board, contains a GSM SIM card
File System sample. This project implements following sequences taking place between
STM32 MCU and Smartcard :
- At power on, Board is waiting for card insertion (LED1 Blinking)
- As soon as card insertion is detected, card is power on, and a list of APDU Command/Response pairs
  are exchanged between application and Smartcard, including PTS procedure (speed negotiation),
  File Selection (MF, DF or EF), Information reading, File content reading (IMSI and ICCID)
- During this steps, all LEDS are turned on.
- When this sequence is completed, Smartcard is powered off, and waiting for user to remove card
  from smartcard slot (LED1 blinking)
- Example is running in loop, so that at this stage, user is prompted again for card insertion ...

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to
      1 millisecond to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32G474QETx devices.

  - This example has been tested with STM32G474E-EVAL Rev B board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32G474QETx Set-up
      Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector
      CN11 (USART1) and PC serial port if you want to display data on the HyperTerminal.
  - STM32G474QETx connected to PC HyperTerminal could be used to follow Smartcard operations progress
    UART to be configured as follow:
        - BaudRate = 115200 baud
        - Word Length = 8 Bits
        - One Stop Bit
        - No parity
        - No Hardware flow control


@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
 - Test output (description of running actions) is available on USART1. Please connect USART1 connector 
   to Hypterminal to follow test progress.
