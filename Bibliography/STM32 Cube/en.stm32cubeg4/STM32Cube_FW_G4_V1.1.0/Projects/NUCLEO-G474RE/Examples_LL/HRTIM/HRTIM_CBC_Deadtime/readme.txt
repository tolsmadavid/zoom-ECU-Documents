@par Example Description 
  This example describes how to implement a cycle-by-cycle (CBC) current control 
  with complementary signals and deadtime insertion.
  An overcurrent condition will turn-off the two complementary outputs, without 
  re-arming the complementary output.
  Refer to the  HRTIM Cookbook for further details.

  Two complementary PWM waveforms are generated on the TD1 and TD2 outputs 
  (PB14 and PB15).
  The over-current digital signal must be connected to both EEV5 and EEV8 external event 
  lines on PB8 and PB9 inputs.

  Green LED: blinks during normal operation on Nucleo board, not active on Discovery board.
  Green LED: ON when the ERROR handler is entered

  The PWM frequency and deadtime duration can be 
  entered respectively in kHz and in ns, using the following User Constants:
  - TIMER_PWM_FREQ
  - DEADTIME_IN_NS

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32G474RETx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with two NUCLEO-G474RE RevC boards embedding
    a STM32G474RET6 device and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
